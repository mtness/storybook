Installation of EXT:storybook and storybook
================================

.. rst-class:: bignums


1. install EXT:storybook

   installation of EXT:storybook is done via composer:

   ..  code-block:: bash
       :caption: install via composer

       composer req andersundsehr/storybook --dev

   It is also possible to install EXT:storybook in legacy mode, but this is not recommended.
   `https://extensions.typo3.org/package/storybook <https://extensions.typo3.org/package/storybook>`_

   ..  tip::
       You still need to use `npm` so you should also use `composer`.

2. install storybook

   ..  code-block:: bash
       :caption: install via npm

       npm install @andersundsehr/storybook-typo3 --save-dev
       # or
       yarn add @andersundsehr/storybook-typo3 --dev

   ..  caution::
       make sure you install the same version for both:

       * composer `andersundsehr/storybook`
       * npm/yarn `@andersundsehr/storybook-typo3`

3. create `/.storybook/` directory

   create a `.storybook` directory besides your `package.json` file.

   you need to update your `STORYBOOK_TYPO3_ENDPOINT` to your TYPO3 instance URL:

   ..  literalinclude:: /dummy-project/.storybook/main.ts
       :caption: .storybook/main.ts
       :language: ts
       :emphasize-lines: 16
       :linenos:

   ..  literalinclude:: /dummy-project/.storybook/preview.ts
       :caption: .storybook/preview.ts
       :language: ts
       :linenos:

4. configure package.json

   add the scripts to your `package.json` file:

   ..  literalinclude:: /dummy-project/package.json
       :caption: package.json
       :language: json
       :emphasize-lines: 4-6

5. DDEV configuration

   **if** you are using `DDEV` you need to add the following to your `.ddev/config.yaml` file:

   ..  code-block:: yaml
       :caption: .ddev/config.yaml

        web_extra_exposed_ports:
        - name: storybook
          container_port: 8080
          http_port: 8081
          https_port: 8080

6. # Now you have a working Storybook setup!

   You can now run Storybook with the following command:

   ..  code-block:: bash
       :caption: start storybook

       npm run storybook
       # or
       yarn storybook

   This will start the Storybook server. You can than access it in your browser at your configured URL.

   ..  tip::
       If you are using vite in your Project, it can interfere with Storybook.
       You can read more about this in the `how to use vite with storybook <

   You can now start creating stories for your TYPO3 Fluid components!

  To access your storybook in the frontend, 
  open http://localhost:8011/
  or, with ddev:
  https://<yourprooject>.ddev.site:8080/
